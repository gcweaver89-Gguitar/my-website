			<h1>What are Modes?</h1>
			<p>Modes are best described as variations of scales. They can be used to convey "feeling" or attitude when writing or improvising, depending on which mode you choose.
			The most important modes to start with are either the Ionion mode (Major scale) or the Aeolian mode (Minor scale).</p>
				<h2>How do I know which mode I'm in and should I stay in a mode once I start?</h2>
				<p>You will know generally by the pattern you will be using and no, you should explore the fretboard utilizing the notes in different modes to convey different feelings or moods</p>
					<h3>Below are the modes in the correct sequence no matter which one you start with. Just like the pentatonic scales, modes follow patterns but instead
					of the next scale starting where the one before ends, it will start on the second note of the low E string.</p>

					<p>To choose a key, you can either start with Ionian (major) or Aeolian (minor) and that will determine whether it is in a major or minor key and the patterns will continue based on the note (key) you start with using these scales</p>
					<p>For example, in the above patterns I started in the G major (Ionian) and E minor (Aeolian) modes. G major and E minor are the relative keys to eachother which mean that they will use the same scale patterns.</p>
