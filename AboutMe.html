			<h1>About Me</h1>
				<h2>My Experience</h2>
				<p>I have over 23 years of guitar playing experience with roughly 7 years of serious music theory practice.
				Like most kids, when I started I thought I was going to be a rockstar and didn't need to learn music theory or even the notes I was playing.
				I had the "if it sounds good....who cares" mentality but it wasn't until I got older that I realized how important learning the basics of music theory is. 
				There is a saying in music about theory and I think it rings true. "You have to know the rules to understand when to break them" is amazing and it really puts it in 
				perspective to the fact that you don't need to follow the rules to a "T" all the time, but knowing them gives you something to fall back on.</p>
